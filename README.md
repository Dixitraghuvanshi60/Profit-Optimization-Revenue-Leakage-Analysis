Calculated total revenue, total profit, and overall margin

Identified uneven profitability across regions

2️⃣ Revenue Leakage Detection

Detected loss-making sub-categories

Identified profit decline beyond discount threshold

3️⃣ Discount Sensitivity Analysis

Analyzed relationship between discount levels and profit

Found margin erosion at aggressive discount levels

4️⃣ Regional Performance Comparison

Compared revenue contribution vs margin efficiency

Identified low-margin high-revenue regions

🚀 Key Business Insights

Certain sub-categories consistently generate negative profit.

Profit margin declines sharply beyond ~20% discount threshold.

Regional margin variation suggests pricing inefficiencies.

Revenue concentration indicates opportunity for strategic optimization.

📈 Strategic Recommendations
