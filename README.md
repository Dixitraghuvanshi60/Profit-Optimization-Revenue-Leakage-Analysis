# 📌 Profit Optimization & Revenue Leakage Analysis

## 🔎 Project Overview
This project analyzes retail transactional data to identify profit erosion drivers and revenue leakage patterns across regions and product categories.

The objective was to move beyond basic reporting and uncover margin inefficiencies impacting overall business profitability.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
- Identify loss-making segments
- Analyze discount impact on profit margins
- Evaluate regional profitability performance
- Provide actionable recommendations for margin optimization

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **SQL (SQLite)** – Advanced queries, CTEs, Window Functions
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** – Data processing & analysis
- **Power BI** – Executive dashboard visualization
- **DAX** – KPI & margin calculations

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains multi-region retail transactional data including:
- Region
- Category
- Sub-Category
- Sales
- Quantity
- Discount
- Profit

The analysis focuses on revenue performance, margin behavior, and discount sensitivity.

## 📈 Key Analysis Performed

### 1️⃣ Revenue & Profit Overview
- Calculated total revenue, total profit, and overall profit margin
- Identified uneven profitability across business segments

### 2️⃣ Revenue Leakage Detection
- Detected loss-making sub-categories
- Analyzed negative margin contributors

### 3️⃣ Discount Sensitivity Analysis
- Evaluated relationship between discount levels and profit
- Identified margin erosion beyond critical discount threshold

### 4️⃣ Regional Margin Intelligence
- Compared revenue contribution vs profitability efficiency
- Identified low-margin high-revenue regions

---

## 🚀 Key Business Insights
- Certain sub-categories consistently generate negative profits.
- Profit margin declines sharply beyond ~20% discount threshold.
- Regional margin variation suggests pricing inefficiencies.
- Revenue concentration indicates opportunity for strategic optimization.

---

## 📌 Strategic Recommendations
- Implement discount cap policy beyond identified threshold
- Optimize pricing for loss-making sub-categories
- Re-evaluate promotional strategies in low-margin regions
- Prioritize high-margin categories for scalable growth

**Estimated Profitability Improvement Potential: 8–12%**
